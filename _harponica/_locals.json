Knowledge of and the ability to use other languages is a basic tool for engaging with the expanding global arena that effects the daily life of Americans and all people around the world. University High School requires students take at least three years of Spanish. Spanish is rapidly becoming a second-language throughout the United States and is particularly significant in Hartford since at least one-third of Hartford residents are native Spanish speakers or children of native Spanish speakers. Admission to most colleges and universities requires that students study at least two years of a foreign language, but three years is preferred. For this reason, it is required that all University High School students take at least three years of Spanish.\n \nWorld Language Learning Outcomes\nStudents will engage in conversation, provide and obtain information, express feelings and exchange opinions using the Spanish language.\nStudents will understand and interpret spoken and written Spanish on a variety of topics and will communicate information, concepts and ideas on a variety of topics both in oral and written Spanish.\nStudents will demonstrate an understanding of the concept of culture through comparisons of the range of Spanish cultures in Europe, Latin America and the United States.\nStudents will reinforce and expand the knowledge acquired in the Global Studies curricula through their study of Spanish language.\n \nSince many schools in the Greater Hartford area require language study prior to high school, it is expected the many students will begin their Spanish classes at the intermediate level. Advance Spanish classes will be offered for students with demonstrated proficiency in both written and oral Spanish. These classes are particularly recommended for native Spanish speakers.

Our goal is to prepare our students to be college ready as well as to be active citizens in a culturally diverse, rapidly changing, and interdependent world.  \n\nDepartment Goals\nStudents will gain knowledge of United States history, world history, civics and government, and geography. \nStudents will apply geographic knowledge, skill and concepts to understanding human behavior in relations to the physical and cultural environment.  \nStudents will acquire an understanding of how ideals, principles and practices of citizenship have emerged over time and across cultures.\nStudents will develop skills in chronological organization of events, the ability to read and interpret primary and secondary historical documents, and to compare and contrast trends across time and place. \nStudents will analyze the historical roots of current world problems including the complexity of relations and conflicts among nations in our increasingly interdependent world.\nStudents will employ the concepts learned in social studies to better understand the development and advancement of scientific and technological discoveries and innovations.\nStudents will demonstrate knowledge of how laws are made and how they regulate the relationship between individual rights and societal needs.
