Knowledge of and the ability to use other languages is a basic tool for engaging with the expanding global arena that effects the daily life of Americans and all people around the world. University High School requires students take at least three years of Spanish. Spanish is rapidly becoming a second-language throughout the United States and is particularly significant in Hartford since at least one-third of Hartford residents are native Spanish speakers or children of native Spanish speakers. Admission to most colleges and universities requires that students study at least two years of a foreign language, but three years is preferred. For this reason, it is required that all University High School students take at least three years of Spanish.\n \nWorld Language Learning Outcomes\nStudents will engage in conversation, provide and obtain information, express feelings and exchange opinions using the Spanish language.\nStudents will understand and interpret spoken and written Spanish on a variety of topics and will communicate information, concepts and ideas on a variety of topics both in oral and written Spanish.\nStudents will demonstrate an understanding of the concept of culture through comparisons of the range of Spanish cultures in Europe, Latin America and the United States.\nStudents will reinforce and expand the knowledge acquired in the Global Studies curricula through their study of Spanish language.\n \nSince many schools in the Greater Hartford area require language study prior to high school, it is expected the many students will begin their Spanish classes at the intermediate level. Advance Spanish classes will be offered for students with demonstrated proficiency in both written and oral Spanish. These classes are particularly recommended for native Spanish speakers. The focus of the advance Spanish classed is the study and interpretation of Spanish literature and the development of critical analysis using the Spanish language. Students who qualify have the option of taking courses in Spanish literature at the University of Hartford.",
