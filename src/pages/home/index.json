Call our main office at 860-695-9020.\n\n\nStaying Home from School when Sick\n\nIf your child has any of the following symptoms, please do not send your child to school and call your child’s health care provider for advice:  fever (temperature over 100.0 degrees F), persistent cough, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, stomach ache, body rash, pain, or weakness. We recommend taking your child’s temperature every morning before school to make sure it is below 100.0 degrees F and it is safe for your child to attend school.  All our elementary schools will be participating in a program called FLUency that will provide each family with a free SMART thermometer. Information about participation in this program will be sent home in September.  Please call your school nurse if your child’s health care provider thinks your child might have COVID-19 or is tested for COVID-19. \n",
