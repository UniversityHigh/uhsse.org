    "Hello Students and Families,\n\nI hope that you are doing well. If you do not have a digital device for learning at home, we will begin distributing laptops to students tomorrow from 9AM to 12 PM at the 15 Hartford Public School sites. (see locations below)  We plan to launch the Continuity of Learning Plan for distance learning on Monday, March 30.  More information will follow this week.  Students must be present to obtain their device. Please bring a bag or a backpack to safely carry the device home.  If your family doesnâ€™t have internet access, you can obtain it for free from Comcast. Instructions are available on the Hartford Public Schools website  ( https://www.hartfordschools.org/helpful-information-about-comcasts-free-internet-access-offer/ ).\n\nBecause of the need for social distancing, the line and the distribution will occur outside. Please dress appropriately.\n\nIf you are unable to make it tomorrow, there will be opportunities to obtain a device on Wednesday and Friday .\n\nhttps://www.hartfordschools.org/understanding-coronavirus/  \n",
