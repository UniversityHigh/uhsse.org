For this reason, it is required that all University High School students take at least three years of Spanish.\n \nWorld Language Learning Outcomes\nStudents will engage in conversation, provide and obtain information, express feelings and exchange opinions using the Spanish language.\nStudents will understand and interpret spoken and written Spanish on a variety of topics and will communicate information, concepts and ideas on a variety of topics both in oral and written Spanish.\nStudents will demonstrate an understanding of the concept of culture through comparisons of the range of Spanish cultures in Europe, Latin America and the United States.\nStudents will reinforce and expand the knowledge acquired in the Global Studies curricula through their study of Spanish language.\n \nSince many schools in the Greater Hartford area require language study prior to high school, it is expected the many students will begin their Spanish classes at the intermediate level.
